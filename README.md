# Twitter Profanity Filter

## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The goal of this project is to build an application that is capable of retrieving the twitter's tweet streaming, apply a filter, and store on a MongoDb database only the tweets that are written in english and do not contain a series of banned words (in this case the [Google's profanity words list](https://www.freewebheaders.com/full-list-of-bad-words-banned-by-google/)).
